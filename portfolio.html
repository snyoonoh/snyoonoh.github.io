                <h3>Galactic Dragon</h3>
                <br>             
                <p>Languages/Technologies: C++, OpenGL, GLFW, GLM, GLEW</p>
                <p>Description: A game created from scratch using C++ with OpenGL framework. The main objective of the game is to control the galactic dragon to dodge incoming asteroids and get get as many points. You will get a point for every asteroid you dodge. But watch out, the more asteroids you dodge, the faster the asteroids get!</p>
                <p>Why it's cool: Space, Dragons, Asteroids!! Need I say more? In all seriousness, what makes this game really cool is that it implements different graphical shader effects that change the entire feel of the game. Some of the shader effects include: Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO), Toon Shading and Depth Shading.

                Languages/Technologies: C++, OpenGL, OpenCV, ARToolKit</p>
                <p>Description: An educational application that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) to make chemistry more enjoyable and comprehensive. Using this app, students can combine different element atoms to create chemical bonds while getting direct visual feedback of their actions!</p>
                <p>Why it's cool: AR!! Augmented Reality gives the user a sense that they are directly interacting with their environments. This makes for an effective and interactive way students can learn chemistry.

                <br> 
                <p>
                Languages/Techonologies: C++ </p>
                <p>
                Description: An application based off of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. While the original game of Kevin Bacon had the player find the shortest path between Kevin Bacon and said actor, this application will show you the shortest path between any two actors. The "connections" between actors are basically movies that they have co-starred in while the "path" between two actors are the mutual actors that connect two actors. To use the application, you input two actors and it shows you the shortest path between the two by listing all the actors and movies within the path.</p> 
                <p>
                Why it's cool: This application utilizes graph and algorithm concepts to achieve its functionality. The actors are nodes and the movies that connect the two actors are the edges. Breadth for Search (BFS) is used to get the shortest path. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to get the shortest path with the most recent movies where the year of release is the weights.</p>

                Description: A simple terminal game of Towers of Hanoi written in JAVA. Utilizes the datastructure stacks to represent the 3 towers. If you solve the puzzle in the miniumum number of steps, you will get a special prompt!</p> 
                <p>
                Why it's cool: The entire game is less than 10KB. It resembles old school command line text-based games. It is super easy to play and still retains the fun of solving a good puzzle.</p>

                <p>
                Why it's cool: I created this website without using any existing templates or drag-and-drop website builders. The overall website layout and theme is designed by myself with the exception of some components.</p>
